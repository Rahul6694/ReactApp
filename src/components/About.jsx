      <div>
        <p>The International Journal of Engineering Research and Generic Science (IJERGS) is a publication model that allows readers worldwide quick access to the full text of research articles without the need for a subscription. As a result, readers are free to reproduce, use, distribute, and display the work publicly, as well as create and distribute derivative works in any digital medium for any lawful purpose, as long as proper authorship attribution is given.</p>

         <p> The author's university or research funds normally cover the publication costs in this scenario. These Open Access fees take the place of subscription fees, allowing publishers to make their content freely available to all online readers. Authors that publish in Open Access journals, on the other hand, keep their article's copyright.</p>
